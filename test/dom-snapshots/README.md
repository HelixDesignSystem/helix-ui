# dom-snapshots

This is where test files for auto-generated regression tests end up. This then leaves behind dom snapshot artifacts next to them, which are *not* ignored by version control. **The test files, however, are ignored by version control**. They are simply generated by the parent test runner script at runtime. It uses standard boilerplate to import a top-level test that simply looks for elements in the dom that are flagged for regression testing, and checks to ensure that none of those elements have had their dom changed.
