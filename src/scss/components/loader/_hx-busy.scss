/*
  NOTE: This implementation is known to be slightly buggy with IE11.
  In various scenarious, IE11 will render the element with a
  "squigglevision"-like appearance. We were unable to pinpoint what
  causes the bug, but factors contributing to it are sub-pixel calculations,
  display + animation property issues, and even border-radius of the parent.

  There's very little we can do about it, because the bug resides in the
  IE rendering engine (which is no longer receiving updates). Design is aware
  of the issue, and has noted that the issue is acceptable for IE compatibility.

  1: explicitly set transform-box for IE/Edge compatibility
  2: explicitly set transform-origin with full X/Y/Z values for IE/Edge compatibility
